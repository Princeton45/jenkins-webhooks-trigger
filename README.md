## Demo Project: Automated CI Pipeline with Webhook

This project demonstrates how I set up an automated Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using a webhook. Now, whenever I make changes to my project in Github, the pipeline in Jenkins is automatically triggered.

## Technologies Used

I used the following technologies in this project:

*   Jenkins
*   Github
*   Git
*   Docker
*   Java
*   Maven

## Project Description

Here's what I achieved in this project:

1. I integrated GitLab with Jenkins by installing the GitLab Plugin in Jenkins. \[*Suggest a picture showing the installed GitLab plugin in Jenkins*]

2. I established a secure connection between GitLab and Jenkins using a GitLab access token. \[*Suggest a picture of the GitLab project settings in Jenkins where the connection is configured*]

3. I configured Jenkins to automatically trigger the CI pipeline whenever a change is pushed to GitLab. \[*Suggest a picture showing the Jenkins build trigger configuration for GitLab webhooks*]

Now my workflow is fully automated, saving me time and ensuring that my code is continuously integrated!
